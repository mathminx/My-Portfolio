#Module 2 challenge - My Portfolio

https://mathminx.github.io/module-2-challenge/

## Description

Using my background in layout design, I created this website to house a portfolio of my work. I will continue to update it as my knowledge and skills develop further, with the aim of using it to show potential employers what I can do. It will be a living document that evolves through successive updates. I learned a great deal about CSS while creating this page, and yet I have only touched the tip of the iceberg. 

## Installation

The project is deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
![alt text](assets/Images/Under Construction.jpg)
