#Module 2 challenge - My Portfolio

https://mathminx.github.io/My-Portfolio/

## Description

Using my background in layout design, I created this website to house a portfolio of my work. I will continue to update it as my knowledge and skills develop further, with the aim of using it to show potential employers what I can do. It will be a living document that evolves through successive updates. I learned a great deal about CSS while creating this page, and yet I have only touched the tip of the iceberg.
